I sold my beloved 2005 Yamaha FZ6 a few days before the trip, used that money to ship way too many things to Belgium, and hopped aboard Alex's Mazda Speed 3 for whatever will ensue.

[[i:GEDC9195.JPG|Alison's cat][p:
We made it to Alison's house in Tallahassee, FL around 3:04 a.m. Our first day started out with a pair of comfy beds, a friendly cat, and a shower. We then got on our way to Louisiana after a somewhat lengthy tripmate conflict (I had inadvertently packed a loaded gun)(F). We drove by Alabama (the way to Mobile was surprisingly pretty) and Mississippi (nothing to see here) and made it to our destination, Uncle Dick Davis Park in the middle of nowhere, Louisiana (Breaux Bridge, between Baton Rouge and Lafayette).

[t:2016-05-25|Breaux Bridge, LO -> Austin, TX|
[p:
We woke up in the Louisiana swamp and witnessed the local mosquitoes' size which is matched only by their voracity.  Alex will never forget. I grabbed a couple pictures at the campsites and we hopped in the car again. Zoom in on the second picture and you will find our most interesting neighbors. We crossed the unusual bridge again and I got to take a couple of well-lit pictures. (Bridge is located in Bayou La Rose, Breaux Bridge, LO. I haven't found its name.)

[p:We made it to Austin relatively bright and early. Kevin took us to the Flightpath coffee house where I had my first hot chocolate of the trip (a "guest" had attached a gnome on their truck) and to the top of [w:Mount Bonnell]. We then met some majestic peacocks at [w:Mayfield-Gutsch Estate], had the greatest tacos at Tyson's Tacos, and encountered the infamous Rundberg Running man.]

[p:
First full day in Texas. It all started at Tacodeli where I had a couple of tasty avocado tacos for breakfast. We went to [w:Hamilton pool], a gorgeous swimmable natural pool fed by a 15m waterfall. Sadly I could not reasonably swim in it because I had burned my leg under my motorcycle engine a week prior (the day I sold it) and I was worried about a likely bacterial infection. Luckily the waterfall was irresistible and I went into the danger zone without a second thought.

[p:We had some epic brisket at Black, stopped by a paisible (TODO: wikipedia and paisible and riffled through) coffee shop at 106 E. Market St., and finally riffled through the Lone Star Gun Range, a Texas tradition about freedom and such. We learned how to handle an AK47, AR15, Walther CCP 9mm, and a Glock26 Gen4 9mm.]

Hi Krista
Thank you for sharing your home, cat love, awesomeness, and teachings. Meeting you has been one of the highlights of my trip.
Would you be comfortable with me posting the picture I took of your dreads on my blog if I am ever to make one?
